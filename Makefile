# There's lots of stuff going on here. The primary targets are listed here:
#
#       make              - Builds the docker container
#
#       make all          - Run unit tests, then build the docker container,
#                           then run the integration tests
#
#       make run          - Build the docker container, then run a single instance
#
#       make cluster      - Build the docker container, then run 3 replicas
#
#       make clean        - This removes any running replicas
#
# When the docker container is build, a script copies all lines of this file which
# don't contain the string DELETE and writes them to a new file Makefile.docker. 
# The Dockerfile builds out of that file instead of this one. This is done because
# otherwise when Docker executes the build step, Make complains about the Docker
# command not being available (since our Docker base image doesn't have it).
